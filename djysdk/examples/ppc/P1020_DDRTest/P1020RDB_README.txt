#	P1020 RDB README
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This stationery project is designed to get you up and running
quickly with CodeWarrior for Power Architecture Development Studio.
It is set up for a particular evaluation board, but can be easily modified
to target custom hardware.  The hardware specific changes that
you may need to make include hardware initialization code, 
UART driver, flash programing code, and possibly the linker
command file for memory map issues.

The New Power Architecture Project wizard can create 2 projects, one for each 
core of P1020. The first core's project (core 0) is responsible for initializing 
the board. The project for the other core only initializes core specific
options, not the whole platform. Therefore launching the project for the second
core requires that the core 0's project is running.

Each project has three targets: 
 - Debug Version
 - ROM Version (only for core #0)
 - Cache ISR Debug Version

Both executables will print "Welcome to CodeWarrior!" out of the common 
serial port (DUART1). To view the output, connect a null-modem serial cable from 
the serial port to your computer. Open a terminal program and set it up to match 
these settings:

Baud Rate: 115200
Data Bits: 8
Parity: None
Stop Bits: 1
Flow Control: None

NOTE!
* The UART libraries are compiled with a specific CCSRBAR address. For different values of the CCSRBAR
you need to rebuild your library:
1) Import the corresponding serial library project from your CW install directory
<CWInstallDir>\PA\PA_Support\Serial\P1020RDB_serial\.project
2) Open duart_config.h file and change the value of the "MMR_BASE" accordingly
3) Switch to the corresponding build target and re-build the project Project > Build Project or Build All (Ctrl+B)

* If you want to redirect output to a debugger console instead of UART driver, 
please follow above instruction to remove UART1_P1020RDB from the project and instead use the ‘syscall.a’ 
library from <CWInstallDir>\PA\PA_Support\SystemCallSupport\Lib\syscall.a or the project Lib Folder.
Also please make sure you "Activate Support for System Services" in the "System Call Services" sub-tab
from the "Debugger" tab in the corresponding debug launch configuration. 
Also please make sure you have the correct library listed in the "Other objects" panel in the project's
Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > Power PC Linker > Input.

* The default baud rate is set at ‘115200’. For changing the baud rate, update PA\PA_Support\ewl\EWL_C\include\pa\uart_console_config.h  
to an appropriate value in the application code and rebuild the runtime library.

*Since reading of "Write-only" SEC KEUKDn registers causes setting of the error flags
in KEUSR and KEUISR registers it is recomended to use "P1020RDB.mem" as memory 
configuration file. You will see the value of these registers
as 0x21212121 in the register window.


From the project menu, select Build All (Ctrl+B) and then launch the appropriate Debug Configuration.  
The debugger should come up at main().  Step past the printf statement and
you should see the output on your terminal.



Memory map and initialization

Burning ROM Version to NOR flash
--------------------------------
CodeWarrior provides a cheat-sheet that will guide you through the steps 
needed to program the flash. You can access the cheat-sheet from Eclipse:
 Help->Cheat Sheets->Using Flash Programmer.
Import the settings from Flash_Programmer\QorIQ_P1\P1020RDB_NOR_FLASH.xml.
Please refer to the cheat-sheet or the CW documentation for instructions on how
to program/verify the ROM image (ROM.mot) generated by the stationery 
project. Please make sure the flash memory is blank before programming. You can do 
this by using the Blank Check feature. The ROM image is located in the last sectors 
of the flash memory to include the CPU's reset address.


The init files can handle the following switch configurations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch settings for CPU: 800 MHz, CCB: 400MHz,DDR: 667 MHz, SYSCLK: 66 MHz
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Switch 	1 	2 	3 	4 	5 	6 	7 	8 
SW3		OFF ON 	ON	OFF OFF	ON 	ON 	OFF
SW2 	OFF ON 	ON 	ON 	ON	ON 	OFF	ON

//	Getting Started
//------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the target settings are already configured for you if you are
using the evaluation board with the stationery.  From the Edit menu,
select {Target Name} Settings... (Alt+F7). Select the Remote Debugging
pref panel from left column.  Make sure that the correct remote connection
is selected.  
We recommend that you make sure the project is working properly with the 
board before you begin adding your own code. Select Debug from the Project 
menu. If everything is working properly, the debugger window should come up 
for both projects and be stopped at main().

The Debug Version target simply runs incrementing a counter in an infinite loop.

//	Adding your own code
//------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once everything is working as expected, you can begin adding your own code
to the project.  Keep in mind that we provide this as an example of how to
get up and running quickly with CodeWarrior.  There are certainly other 
ways to set up your linker command file or handle interrupts.  Feel free
to modify any of the source provided.
